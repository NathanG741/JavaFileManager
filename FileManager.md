# FileManager

An amazingly useless tool!

- list : list all folders/files given a path to a directory, say empty if empty, or wrong path if the path does not exist.
- 
- info : list information given a path to a file/folder. Info includes name, 
- absolute path, relative path, size, date/time created date, and last modified date.
- 
- mkdir : create directory, check for naming.
- 
- rename : getting path of file to be renamed and then removes file?
- 
- copy, move : copy or move folder/file 
- 
- delete : deletes file/folder given a path (test/bar)
- 
- quit : leaves the terminal
